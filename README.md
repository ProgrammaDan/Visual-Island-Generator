# Visual-Island-Generator
This project finds the largest island (where cardinally adjacent instances of the same digit make an island) in a user defined 2D matrix of random 1's and 0's, and displays the result using color and pleasant formatting. This program could be used by artists and creatives to generate random shapes their craft and for inspiration
