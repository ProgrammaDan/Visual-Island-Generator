# Visual-Island-Generator
This project finds the largest island (where cardinally adjacent instances of the same digit make an island) in a user defined 2D matrix of random 1's and 0's, and displays the result using color and pleasant formatting. This program could be used by artists and creatives to generate random shapes their craft and for inspiration

How does this program work?
Typically, navigating a matrix of unknown values is done via BFS or DFS. For extra challenge, the program was written on the condition of using neither. Instead, the solution revolves around generating and storing a 'mini island' consisting of all available cardinally adjacent cells for all locations that contain a '1' in the 2D matrix, then iteratively combining mini islands that share at least one coordinate with each other into larger islands, until no further combines can be performned. What is left is a list of every island of cardinal "1"s in the matrix. The rest of the work is simply to indentify the island with the greatest size and represent the data visually such that the largest island is distinctly visible.
